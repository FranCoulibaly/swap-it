# Swap it

## Overview
A simple tool built in React especially for knitters and crocheters (and those who aspire to be).
This uses the [Ravelry API]((https://github.com/walkerkq/ravelRy)https://github.com/walkerkq/ravelRy) and is intended to be used as a tool to find suitable yarn substitutions for your projects or to access the attributes of a specific yarn.
Yarns can be filtered by name, fiber type, brand or weight.
